## 🧠 Medical Imaging & Radiology Data Analysis (Core Expertise)

I work with **clinical radiology data** and build AI systems that understand real medical imaging:

- 🧲 **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** – brain & soft-tissue pattern analysis  
- 🩻 **CT (Computed Tomography)** – organ segmentation, anomaly & density detection  
- 🏥 **DICOM Processing** – metadata, pixel spacing, Hounsfield Units (HU)  
- 📊 **Clinical Feature Engineering** – linking imaging data with lab & patient records  
- 🔍 **Radiology-Oriented Analytics** – texture, intensity & morphological patterns  

**Tools & Tech:**  
Python, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, SimpleITK, PyDicom, scikit-learn, PyTorch  

**Related Projects:**
- **medical-image-ai-pipeline** – CT/MRI preprocessing & deep learning  
- **diabetes-early-detection-ml** – Imaging + clinical data ML models
